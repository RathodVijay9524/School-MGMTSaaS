# 🏢 Multi-Tenant School Management System

## 📋 Overview

This application implements **BUSINESS CONTEXT** based multi-tenancy where each logged-in user (business owner) can only access and manage **their own data**.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Business Context Pattern:**

```
Business Owner (User with ROLE_OWNER)
    ├── Creates Students
    ├── Creates Teachers  
    ├── Creates Classes
    ├── Creates Workers/Employees
    └── Manages all their own data

Logged-In User ID = Business Context
→ All queries filtered by owner_id
→ Complete data isolation between businesses
```

---

## 🔐 Implementation Details

### **1. Entity Level:**

**Student Entity** now has:
```java
// Business Owner (Multi-tenancy)
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@JoinColumn(name = "owner_id", nullable = false)
private User owner; // Business owner who created this student
```

### **2. Service Level:**

**Every operation uses Business Context:**
```java
// Get logged-in user (Business Owner)
CustomUserDetails loggedInUser = CommonUtils.getLoggedInUser();
User owner = userRepository.findById(loggedInUser.getId())
    .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("User", "id", loggedInUser.getId()));

log.info("Business Owner: {} (ID: {}) creating student", 
    owner.getUsername(), owner.getId());

// Set owner when creating
student.setOwner(owner);
```

### **3. Repository Level:**

**All queries filtered by owner_id:**
```java
// Multi-tenancy queries
Page<Student> findByOwner_IdAndIsDeletedFalse(Long ownerId, Pageable pageable);

Page<Student> findByOwner_IdAndStatusAndIsDeletedFalse(
    Long ownerId, Student.StudentStatus status, Pageable pageable);

@Query("SELECT s FROM Student s WHERE s.owner.id = :ownerId ...")
Page<Student> searchStudentsByOwner(@Param("ownerId") Long ownerId, ...);
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Scenario: Two Business Owners**

**Business Owner 1 (School A):**
- Username: `karina`
- User ID: `1`
- Creates 100 students
- All students have `owner_id = 1`

**Business Owner 2 (School B):**
- Username: `john`
- User ID: `2`
- Creates 80 students
- All students have `owner_id = 2`

### **When karina logs in:**
```
GET /api/v1/students
→ CommonUtils.getLoggedInUser() returns karina (ID: 1)
→ Query: findByOwner_IdAndIsDeletedFalse(ownerId=1)
→ Returns ONLY karina's 100 students
→ john's 80 students are INVISIBLE to karina
```

### **When john logs in:**
```
GET /api/v1/students
→ CommonUtils.getLoggedInUser() returns john (ID: 2)
→ Query: findByOwner_IdAndIsDeletedFalse(ownerId=2)
→ Returns ONLY john's 80 students
→ karina's 100 students are INVISIBLE to john
```

## 🔒 Data Isolation

### **Complete Isolation:**

| Operation | Business Context |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Create Student** | Automatically set `owner_id` from logged-in user |
| **Get All Students** | Filter by `owner_id` of logged-in user |
| **Search Students** | Search only within logged-in user's students |
| **Get by Class** | Show only logged-in user's students in that class |
| **Get by Status** | Filter by status AND owner_id |
| **Count Students** | Count only logged-in user's students |

### **Database Level:**

```sql
-- karina's query (user_id = 1)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE owner_id = 1 AND is_deleted = false;

-- john's query (user_id = 2)  
SELECT * FROM students WHERE owner_id = 2 AND is_deleted = false;

-- COMPLETE DATA ISOLATION
```

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### **students table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(255),
    last_name VARCHAR(255),
    admission_number VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    -- ... other fields ...
    
    user_id BIGINT,              -- Optional: Student's own login
    owner_id BIGINT NOT NULL,    -- REQUIRED: Business owner
    
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES users(id)  -- Multi-tenancy
);

-- Index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_students_owner ON students(owner_id);
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **1. Business Owner Creates Student:**

```bash
# Login as karina
POST /api/auth/login
Body: {"usernameOrEmail": "karina", "password": "karina"}
Response: {"jwtToken": "..."}

# Create student (owner_id automatically set to karina's ID)
POST /api/v1/students
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {karina's_token}
Body: {
    "firstName": "Rahul",
    "lastName": "Sharma",
    "admissionNumber": "STU20240001",
    ...
}

# Behind the scenes:
# student.setOwner(karina) // Automatically set
# owner_id = 1
```

### **2. Get All Students (Auto-Filtered):**

```bash
# karina gets HER students
GET /api/v1/students
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {karina's_token}

# Behind the scenes:
# getLoggedInUser() → karina (ID: 1)
# findByOwner_IdAndIsDeletedFalse(ownerId=1)
# Returns ONLY karina's students
```

### **3. Search (Within Business Context):**

```bash
# karina searches HER students
GET /api/v1/students/search?keyword=rahul
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {karina's_token}

# Behind the scenes:
# searchStudentsByOwner(ownerId=1, keyword="rahul")
# Searches ONLY within karina's students
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### **Role-Based Dashboard (Already Implemented):**

```javascript
// Frontend already has role-based dashboard
// Backend now provides data isolation

// When karina logs in:
Dashboard.getStudents() 
→ API: GET /api/v1/students
→ Backend filters by owner_id automatically
→ Frontend displays ONLY karina's students
```

### **No Frontend Changes Needed:**
✅ Frontend makes same API calls  
✅ Backend automatically filters by business owner  
✅ Complete data isolation without frontend changes  

---

## 👥 User Roles & Relationships

### **Existing Relationships:**

```
User (Business Owner)
    ├── OneToMany → Workers (Employees) [ALREADY EXISTS]
    ├── OneToMany → Students [NOW ADDED]
    ├── OneToMany → Teachers [TO BE ADDED]
    ├── OneToMany → Classes [TO BE ADDED]
    └── OneToMany → All other entities [TO BE ADDED]
```

### **Role Hierarchy:**

- **ROLE_ADMIN**: Super admin (sees all businesses)
- **ROLE_OWNER**: Business owner (sees only their data)
- **ROLE_TEACHER**: Teacher (sees only assigned classes)
- **ROLE_STUDENT**: Student (sees only own data)
- **ROLE_PARENT**: Parent (sees only child's data)

---

## 🎯 Testing Multi-Tenancy

### **Test Scenario:**

1. **Create Business Owner 1 (karina):**
   - Login as karina
   - Create 5 students
   - All students have owner_id = 1

2. **Create Business Owner 2 (john):**
   - Login as john  
   - Create 5 students
   - All students have owner_id = 2

3. **Verify Isolation:**
   - Login as karina → GET /api/v1/students → See only 5 students (karina's)
   - Login as john → GET /api/v1/students → See only 5 students (john's)
   - **Complete isolation! ✅**
