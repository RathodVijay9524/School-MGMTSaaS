## üîê Authentication Testing

### 1. Register New Admin User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9091/api/auth/register/admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "test_admin",
    "password": "password123",
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "name": "Test Admin",
    "phoNo": "9876543210"
  }'
```

### 2. Login as Admin
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9091/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "usernameOrEmail": "admin",
    "password": "admin"
  }'
```

### 3. Login as Teacher (Worker User)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9091/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "usernameOrEmail": "teacher_sapna",
    "password": "teacher_sapna"
  }'
```

### 4. Login as Student (Worker User)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9091/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "usernameOrEmail": "student_sapna",
    "password": "student_sapna"
  }'
```

**Expected Results:**
- All login attempts should return 200 OK
- JWT token should be generated for each user type
- User details should be returned correctly

# Test Authentication
$loginBody = @{
    usernameOrEmail = "admin"
    password = "admin"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$loginResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:9091/api/auth/login" -Method POST -Body $loginBody -ContentType "application/json"
$jwtToken = $loginResponse.data.jwtToken

Write-Host "‚úÖ Login successful! JWT Token: $($jwtToken.Substring(0,50))..."

# Test Worker Creation
$headers = @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $jwtToken"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"

```bash
# Test login endpoint with 100 requests
ab -n 100 -c 10 -p login_data.json -T application/json http://localhost:9091/api/auth/login

# Test worker creation with 50 requests
ab -n 50 -c 5 -p worker_data.json -T application/json -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" http://localhost:9091/api/v1/workers
```

### Response Time Benchmarks
- **Login**: < 500ms
