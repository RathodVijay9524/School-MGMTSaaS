# üß† RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration Guide

## Overview

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) has been integrated into your School Management System to provide intelligent, context-aware responses based on your actual school data. This makes your AI chatbot incredibly smart and helpful!

## üéØ What RAG Does for Your School System

### **Before RAG:**
- Generic AI responses
- No access to your school's actual data
- Limited context awareness
- Basic question answering

### **After RAG:**
- **Intelligent Responses** based on your school's real data
- **Context-Aware** answers using exam schedules, student records, policies
- **Multi-Tenant Support** - each school gets their own data
- **Real-Time Information** - always up-to-date with latest school data

## üìä RAG Components

### 1. **Vector Database (PostgreSQL + pgvector)**
- Stores document embeddings for fast similarity search
- Multi-tenant support with owner-based filtering
- Efficient cosine similarity search

### 2. **Document Indexing Service**
- Automatically indexes school data (exams, students, subjects, policies)
- Scheduled reindexing to keep data fresh
- Batch processing for performance

### 3. **RAG Service**
- Combines document retrieval with real-time data
- Multi-tenant security enforcement
- Context-aware response generation

### 4. **RAG-Enhanced MCP Tools**
- Traditional MCP tools enhanced with RAG intelligence
- 6 new intelligent tools for different use cases
