## üîê Authentication System

### Dual Authentication Architecture
The system supports two distinct user types with a unified login endpoint:

#### Regular Users (Users Table)
- **School Owners**: Full system access
- **Administrators**: School management access
- **Super Users**: Multi-tenant management

#### Worker Users (Workers Table)
- **Teachers**: Student and class management
- **Students**: Personal profile access
- **Staff**: Administrative support roles

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits login credentials
2. System checks both `users` and `workers` tables
3. Determines user type automatically
4. Generates appropriate JWT token
5. Creates refresh token with correct foreign key references

### Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Refresh token mechanism
- Password encryption
- Session management
