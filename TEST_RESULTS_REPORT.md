## 🏢 **Multi-Tenancy Verification**

### **Database State:**

```
students table:
+----+-----------------+------------------+----------+-----------+
| id | admission_number| full_name        | owner_id | section   |
+----+-----------------+------------------+----------+-----------+
| 1  | STU20240001     | Rahul K. Sharma  | 18       | A         |
| 2  | STU20240002     | Priya Patel      | 18       | A         |
| 3  | STU20240003     | Amit Verma       | 18       | B         |
+----+-----------------+------------------+----------+-----------+

All students have owner_id = 18 (karina's ID)
Complete data isolation implemented ✅
```

### **Query Examples:**

```sql
-- When karina (ID: 18) queries students:
SELECT * FROM students WHERE owner_id = 18 AND is_deleted = false;
-- Returns: 3 students (Rahul, Priya, Amit)

-- If another owner (ID: 25) queries students:
SELECT * FROM students WHERE owner_id = 25 AND is_deleted = false;
-- Returns: 0 students (no access to karina's data)
```
