### **OVERALL STATUS:**
- ✅ **Complete Modules:** 30/38 (79%)
- ⚠️ **Partial Modules:** 4/38 (11%)
- ❌ **Missing Modules:** 4/38 (10%)

## ❌ CRITICAL GAPS - ENTITIES WITHOUT CONTROLLERS/SERVICES

### **1. 📚 COURSE MANAGEMENT** ❌ COMPLETELY MISSING
**Entity:** ✅ `Course.java` (EXISTS)  
**Repository:** ✅ `CourseRepository.java` (EXISTS)  
**Service:** ❌ **MISSING**  
**Controller:** ❌ **MISSING**  
**DTOs:** ❌ **MISSING**

**What the Entity Has:**
```java
- Course Code (CS101, BIO202, etc.)
- Course Name & Description
- Subject & SchoolClass relationship
- Teacher assignment
- Start/End dates & Semester
- Credits & Max Students
- Enrollment tracking
- Course Status (PLANNED, ONGOING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- Syllabus & Schedule
- Classroom assignment
```

**What You're Missing:**
- ❌ POST `/api/v1/courses` - Create course
- ❌ GET `/api/v1/courses` - List all courses
- ❌ GET `/api/v1/courses/{id}` - Get course details
- ❌ PUT `/api/v1/courses/{id}` - Update course
- ❌ DELETE `/api/v1/courses/{id}` - Delete course
- ❌ GET `/api/v1/courses/class/{classId}` - Courses by class

**Impact:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 **CRITICAL**  
**Why It Matters:** Courses are fundamental to academic management. Without this, you can't track:
- What students are enrolled in what courses
- Teacher workload distribution
- Course capacity and availability
- Semester planning

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 days  
**Difficulty:** Easy (standard CRUD with relationships)
