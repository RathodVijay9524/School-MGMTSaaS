**Entity:** ✅ `Course.java` (EXISTS)  
**Repository:** ✅ `CourseRepository.java` (EXISTS)  
**Service:** ❌ **MISSING**  
**Controller:** ❌ **MISSING**  
**DTOs:** ❌ **MISSING**

- Course Name & Description
- Subject & SchoolClass relationship
- Teacher assignment
- Start/End dates & Semester
- Credits & Max Students
- Enrollment tracking
- Course Status (PLANNED, ONGOING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- Syllabus & Schedule
- Classroom assignment
```

**What You're Missing:**
- ❌ POST `/api/v1/courses` - Create course
- ❌ GET `/api/v1/courses` - List all courses
- ❌ GET `/api/v1/courses/{id}` - Get course details
- ❌ PUT `/api/v1/courses/{id}` - Update course
- ❌ DELETE `/api/v1/courses/{id}` - Delete course

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 days  
**Difficulty:** Easy (standard CRUD with relationships)
