  - ✅ **Business Context** (multi-tenancy)
  - ✅ Automatic owner_id assignment
  - ✅ All queries filtered by logged-in user
  - ✅ Data isolation between business owners
  - ✅ Business logic calculations
  - ✅ Exception handling

## 🏗️ **Multi-Tenant Architecture (COMPLETE)**

### **Key Implementation:**

```
User (karina) logs in
    ↓
CommonUtils.getLoggedInUser() → User ID: 1
    ↓
Creates Student → student.owner_id = 1
    ↓
Get All Students → WHERE owner_id = 1
    ↓
Returns ONLY karina's students
    ↓
Complete data isolation ✅
```

### **Benefits:**
✅ **Multiple schools** can use the same system  
✅ **Complete data isolation** between schools  
✅ **Automatic filtering** by logged-in user  
✅ **No cross-business access** possible  
✅ **Scales to unlimited** number of schools  
✅ **Single database**, multiple tenants
