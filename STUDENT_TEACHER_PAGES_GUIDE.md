## 🔄 Smart Filtering

### **How Role Filtering Works:**

The system fetches all workers and then filters by role:

```javascript
// For Students page
const students = allWorkers.filter(worker => 
    worker.roles.some(role => 
        role.name === 'ROLE_STUDENT'
    )
);

// For Teachers page
const teachers = allWorkers.filter(worker => 
    worker.roles.some(role => 
        role.name === 'ROLE_TEACHER'
    )
);
```

This ensures:
- Students page shows ONLY students
- Teachers page shows ONLY teachers
- No mixing of different worker types

---

## 📊 Tab Counts

Each tab shows a count badge:

```
👥 All Students    [25]
✅ Active          [23]
❌ Deleted         [1]
⏰ Expired         [1]
```

Counts update automatically when:
- Adding new student/teacher
- Deleting
- Restoring
- Changing status

---

## 🚀 Quick Actions

### **On Students Page:**
```
[+ Add New Student] ← Top right button
```

```

Both open the same modals as the Owner Dashboard!
